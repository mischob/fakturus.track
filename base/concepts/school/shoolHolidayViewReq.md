# Show time not worked in School Holidays

I want to have another total number (shown on Fakturus.Track.Frontend\Pages\Overview.razor) of work hours that was not worked in following condition:

Workdays (according to the settings where normally work will happen) that are located in school holidays of the Bundesland and which are also not 
marked as vacation day. So i want to know the total amount of hours for the respective year that was covered "by overtime" within a school vacation.
