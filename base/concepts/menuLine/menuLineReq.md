# Add Menu Line

Our UI (Fakturus.Track.Frontend) has now most of the functionality. 
But now we want to rework the control of the page a little and add more features: 

## Menu Line

The Frontent shall be updated to provide a similar menu line in the bottom as the poi app (C:\Projects\Fakturus\fakturus.poi) which always stay in the bottom and provide the main 
entries:

1) Zeiten
This will lead to the current view where we can add new sessions and see the history sessions
2) Urlaub
This is a new feature see below
3) Gesamt
This is a new feature see below
4) Settings
This is a new feature see below
